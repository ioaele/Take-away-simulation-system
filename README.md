**Last Updated:** 16/04/2024 

The Take-away Simulation System is designed to emulate the workflow of a take-away restaurant. 
It includes components for order generation, food preparation, and order delivery. 
The system models different food items such as fries, pies, and various meats, each with specific preparation processes.


**Features**

- Order Generation:
  Simulates incoming customer orders with varying items and quantities.

- Food Preparation:
  Models the cooking processes for different food items, including fries, pies, and meats like chicken, pork, and seftalia.

- Order Delivery:
  Manages the dispatch and delivery of prepared orders to customers.

- Factory Pattern Implementation:
 Utilizes the factory design pattern for creating instances of food items, promoting scalabilit

**Running**
- run the class Order Generator: Generates orders, sorts them based on order time, and writes them to a file.
- run the class Order Delivery: Simulates order deliveries based on input data.
